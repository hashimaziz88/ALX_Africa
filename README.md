**Backend Web Development:**

Throughout the backend web development specialization, I delved into the intricacies of backend programming, utilizing Python and Django to build robust web applications. Key topics covered include:

- Backend Language: Python
- Web Framework: Django
- Database Management: SQL (MySQL, SQLite) and NoSQL (MongoDB)
- API Development: REST API, Authentication, and other backend concepts

### Capstone Projects:

**Project 1: Building a Complete Django Application**

Developed a comprehensive web application using Django, implementing models, views, and templates for dynamic content management. Integration of user authentication and authorization added a layer of security and personalization to the application.

**Project 2: Building and Deploying a Django API**

Created a RESTful API using Django REST Framework, implementing CRUD operations for resource management. Deployment of the API to a cloud service ensured scalability and accessibility.
